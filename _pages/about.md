Hi there! I am currently pursuing my Ph.D. at the University of Queensland under the guidance of Prof. Hongzhi Yin and Dr. Tong Chen. Between July and December 2021, I served as a research intern at Peking University, working with Prof. Bin Cui and Dr. Wentao Zhang. Before this, I completed my M.S. and B.S. degrees in Information and Communications Engineering at Xi'an Jiaotong University, graduating in 2021 and 2018, respectively.
