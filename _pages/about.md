Hi there! I am currently a Ph.D. candidate at the University of Queensland, supervised by Prof. Hongzhi Yin and Dr. Tong Chen. 
From July 2021 to Dec. 2021, he worked as a research intern at Peking University with Prof. Bin Cui and Dr. Wentao Zhang. 
Prior to that, I completed my M.S. and B.S. degrees in Information and Communications Engineering from Xi'an Jiaotong University in 2021 and 2018, respectively.
